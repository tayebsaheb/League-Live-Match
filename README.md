# League-Live-Match

This Program will retrieve all the players in a ranked 5v5 match. If you are in a game, type your summoner id , and the program 
will show you the players in your game, their rank, their spells, and their wins and losses.

Some things I used to create this program:

Scenebuilder

JavaFX

Multi Dimensional Arrays

GSON

JSON

Riot API to retrieve data


Note** If you try to download this and run it , it will not run, the API key used is for 24 hours, never bothered to get one that will last longer.
