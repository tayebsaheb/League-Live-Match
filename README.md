# League-Live-Match

This Program will retrieve all the players in a ranked 5v5 match. If you are in a game, type your summoner id , and the program 
will show you the players in your game, their rank, their spells, and their wins and losses.

Some things I used to create this program:

Scenebuilder
JavaFX
Multi Dimensional Arrays
GSON
JSON
